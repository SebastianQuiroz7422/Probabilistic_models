Probabilistic models

based on boltzmann machines (BM), different versions of BM, the restricted BM (RBM) and the Recurrent Temporal RBM (RTRBM).
The RTRBM is also implemented with the autograd function, however due to the intractability of the model the gradients are approximated by the psuedo log-likelihood, similiarly for the RTRBM with a gaussian hidden unit potential.
